I like to keep myself occupied, previously exemplified by my involvement in several student organizations while I studied (one in which I still partake with my time and effort, albeit in diminishing manner). Since I completed my master thesis this fall, I've tried to limit my involvement, and concentrate on work and getting on route with my life as a professional. I believe myself to be on the right path now, and hope to increase my involvement once again, as this post will describe.

<span class="more"></span>

So what do I hope to involve myself in? Well, there are several projects out there, several events I want to attend, and several talks I want to hold. So lets just get on with it.

## Projects

<strong><a href="https://github.com/holderdeord/">Holder de ord</a> (HDO):</strong> During the last months of my study, I kept an eye out for HDO. This not-for-profit, politically independent entrepreneurship aims to be a watchdog on Norwegian politics, specifically by analyzing the data shared by the Storting, the Norwegian Parliament, and share it in a discoverable and easily consumable manner.

I quickly joined HDO when the thesis was completed, but I quickly realized I couldn&#8217;t spare the time necessary. For the spring of 2013 I&#8217;ll make a better effort to change this, and I&#8217;ve already signed me up for their monthly hackatons (you can too; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/141520302664699/">January</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/476487999069718/">February</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/111087629060034/">March</a>, and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/392300807514529/">April</a> is out!).

<strong><a href="https://github.com/megoth/graphitejs">graphite.js</a>:</strong> I really want to keep up the development of the project that came out of my thesis. I&#8217;ve also been approached by one of the author of JSON-LD, <a href="https://twitter.com/markuslanthaler">Markus Lanthaler</a>, asking me to update <a href="https://github.com/megoth/graphitejs/blob/master/src/graphite/rdfparser/jsonld.js">my JSON-LD processor</a>, so first and foremost I&#8217;ll try to do that.

<strong><a href="http://tg.ifi.uio.no/">UiO: Campus TG</a>:</strong> <a href="http://www.gathering.org/">The Gathering</a> (TG) is an annual event at Vikingskipet, Hamar (Norway). Basicly it&#8217;s a huge computer party, with five thousand participants, mostly teenage boys. I&#8217;ll be joining the efforts of UiO to convince these young, bright minds to study at UiO. As part of this effort, my plan is to give three lectures; one that aims to teach basic JavaScript for beginners, and two that will involve a tutorial. As part of this, there are three minor (*cough* famous last words *cough*) projects:

* A to-do list (yeah, I know, original) made with basic JavaScript, for which the purpose is to be used as a teaching tool; The data types involved, the setup, the decisions, etc, will be part of a tutorial I hope to go through. The first lecture will go through a non-persistent to-do list (perhaps only &#8220;saving&#8221; to cookies); the second part will be a collaboration with one of the other lecturers, who will create a server application with another programming language that will talk with the to-do app.
* Tetris! Yeah, I know, another original idea; But the goal is to use it to gain knowledge on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/gamepad/">W3&#8242;s gamepad specs</a>, and probably work with <a href="http://www.gamepadjs.com/">gamepad.js</a>. I think that can be a cool demo to show at TG.
* Rubik&#8217;s Cube: Based on my learning on the gamepad <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, I want to embellish the concept by combining it with <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a>, and create a Rubik&#8217;s Cube in 3D, and enabling controls with a gamepad (and keyboard of course).

The two latter projects require me to buy a gamepad. <a href="#disqus_thread">Any advice are appreciated</a>. Also, to start my work with Tetris, I&#8217;ll look into the <a href="git://git.neuf.no/tetris.git">Tetris project hosted at git.neuf.no</a>. Any hints at other projects are also appreciated.

### Edit

I also hope to contribute to <a href="https://github.com/steinjak/LessDocs">LessDocs</a>, a project I&#8217;ve neglected for to long already. It&#8217;s initiated by my colleague Stein Jakob Nordbø, and we hope to make use of it at the center.

## Events

This will depend more on what my workplace can afford, but hopefully I can be on all of the following:

<strong><a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon London</a>:</strong> This is already decided, and the whole development team at the center will participate. Really looking forward to this, as it will probably be the first I participate as a non-student.

<strong><a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/">Norwegian Developer Conference</a>:</strong> Considering the expensive trip to London, this is more uncertain, but I&#8217;ll keep my fingers crossed.

<strong><a href="http://webrebels.org/">Web Rebels</a>:</strong> A conference focusing on web development in Oslo? I got to be a part of it!

## Talks

This might be too ambitious, but I hope that my lectures on TG are positive, and that it may improve my presentation skills. Apart from these lectures, I have no concrete goals, but the workplace is always interested in being taught about the developments within web technologies, so I&#8217;ll probably give some talks there.

### Edit

Apart from the talks I would like to do, there are a bunch of arenas I&#8217;m going to follow in hope to find interesting talks. I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a>, and can recommend several groups, such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/framsia/">framsia</a>, <a href="http://www.baksia.org/">baksia</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/osloopendata/">Oslo Open Data Forum</a>. I also hope to go to more talks by <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Socially-Functional/">Oslo &#8220;Socially Functional Programmers&#8221; #OsloSFP</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/GDGOslo/">GDG Oslo</a>.
