            <p>I've been thinking about a story for a while. The inspiration was a panel discussion on games named <a href="http://www.frittord.no/aktuelt/digitale-liv-nye-ord-om-spill/">Digitale liv - nye ord om spill</a> (Norwegian, means something like Digital lifes - new words on games) that were arranged December 2nd by <a href="http://www.fritt-ord.no/">Fritt Ord</a>. About a month later, I finally got it out of my head, and I've published it at Medium.</p>
<p>It's a fictional short story named <a href="https://medium.com/@megoth/ramblings-of-a-disturbed-mind-f8b2b19965f9">Ramblings of a disturbed mind</a>, and it takes about 21 minutes to read. I hope you enjoy it ^_^</p>
