        <Project title="graphitejs">
            <p>graphitejs was a framework that I built as part of my master thesis <a href="http://graphitethesis.icanhasweb.net/">A JavaScript API for accessing Semantic Web</a>. It sports the capabilities of storing and querying data stored as RDF in a triple store that runs on a website, and also offers a couple of utility functions when working with the data. Unfortunately it's very slow...</p>
<p>I would love to work more on a project that intersects JavaScript and Semantic Web, maybe even improve on this framework, but I don't see how I could spare the time needed to undertake such an endeavor.</p>
