graphitejs was a framework that I built as part of my master thesis [A JavaScript API for accessing Semantic Web](http://graphitethesis.icanhasweb.net/). It sports the capabilities of storing and querying data stored as RDF in a triple store that runs on a website, and also offers a couple of utility functions when working with the data. Unfortunately it's very slow...

I would love to work more on a project that intersects JavaScript and Semantic Web, maybe even improve on this framework, but I don't see how I could spare the time needed to undertake such an endeavor.
