            <p>hdo-budget was an experiment conducted by <a href="https://www.holderdeord.no/">Holder de ord</a> to explore how to present a state budget using the capabilities of a web app in a manner that was easy-to-understand and meaningful in terms of gaining insight.</p>
<p>We utilized <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> as the main engine behind the site.</p>
