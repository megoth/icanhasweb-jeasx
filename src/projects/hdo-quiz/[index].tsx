            <p>hdo-quiz is a small mobile app that explores the possibility of having a quiz-app that draws political promises from the APIs of <a href="https://www.holderdeord.no/">Holder de ord</a> and prompts the user to guess which party made the promise by swiping the promise to a given by party to the left or to the right of the screen (i.e. Tinder-like interface).</p>
<p><a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> is the main framework used to build the app, and <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> is used to structure and bundle the code.</p>
<p>I've been developing the code alone for now, but may include more members of the Holder de ord-team if we decide to explore the app further.</p>
