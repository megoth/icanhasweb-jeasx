            <p>&quot;TG Hacking Compo&quot; is the website used to serve the hacking competition at <a href="http://www.gathering.org/tg13/">The Gathering 2013</a>. It served a set of tasks designed by <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Aleksi/">Aleksi Luukkonen</a>, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/hansffu/">Hans Fredrik Furholt</a>, and Julian Bark Jark. It proved a bit unstable during the computer party, but it did the job.</p>
