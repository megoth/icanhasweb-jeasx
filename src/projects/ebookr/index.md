ebookr was intended to be a framework for creating e-books in various formats (PDF, HTML, EPUB, and MOBI). The idea was to have the content coded into one given format (markdown) and generate various documents based on that. It used Pandoc extensively, but had ambitions to bridge the gaps between LaTeX and the other formats by supplying adapters for various LaTeX packages.

Unfortunately I haven't had time to pursue this project any further. It may be revitalized at a later time.
