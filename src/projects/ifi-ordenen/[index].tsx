            <p>Ifi-ordenen is the official website of <a href="http://ordenen.ifi.uio.no/">Hennes Majestet Keiserpingvinen den Fornemme</a> (Her Majesty the Royal Penguin the Distinguished), a knight order that focuses on honoring people that have accomplished great deeds for the students at <a href="http://ifi.uio.no">Department of Informatics</a>.</p>
<p>The website consists of static HTML-pages that are built using <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>, whereas the CSS is structured using <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a>.</p>
<p>I've been the main driver behind this project, primarily as developer, but have received help from my fellow members in producing content.</p>
