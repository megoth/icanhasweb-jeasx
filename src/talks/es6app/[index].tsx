        <Talk title="Building a web app with ES6">
            <p>&quot;Building a web app with ES6&quot; is a presentation constructed as a part of a workshop at <a href="http://sonen.ifi.uio.no/">Åpen sone for eksperimentell informatikk</a>. The goal was to introduce the participants to ES6 using <a href="http://jspm.io/">JSPM</a>, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>. The goal was a bit ambitious, to say the least...</p>
<p>The presentation is using a web app, and throughout the presentation you're building the presentation itself. I still like the idea, but the participants need to have a bit of knowledge on JavaScript.</p>
