            <p>Introduction to webpack was a presentation I held for the developer team at <a href="http://www.questback.com/">Questback</a>. The purpose was to showcase the need for this system, to highlight how the old system worked, and how webpack could help us transition to a better, more maintainable codebase.</p>
