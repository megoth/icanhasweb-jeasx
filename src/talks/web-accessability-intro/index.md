"An introduction to Web Accessability" is a presentation I held for the team at [Center for Shared Decision Making and Collaborative Care Research](http://communicaretools.org/about/organisasjon/). It presented the various [WCAG-standards](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), what is required by Norwegian law ([as presented by Difi](http://uu.difi.no/)), which resources are available and how to conduct tests.
